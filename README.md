## qt_photoScanner
a qt+opencv program for converting a file picture to pdf 

### Usage
press **Browse** for choosing the picture, **Run** for corner detecting, and **Save** for saving to pdf. 
Check the **Colorful** checkbox if colors are needed, or it will be only black and white.<br>
<br>
After pressing **Run**, there will be a shrink picture with four blue spots marked. These dots will become the four corners of the outcoming pdf.
Press the blue dot once, it will turn to green. And then you can press the other location where you want the corner to be. After finishing
the modification, press **Save**.
<br>
Please make sure the background of the pictire is simple and without any other corners for the correctness of the corner finding.
